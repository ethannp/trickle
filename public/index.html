                <h2>How to Play TRICKLE</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    TRICKLE is a 2-player Wordle variant, in which players are trying to guess the other player's word, while simultaneously thwarting the other player from guessing theirs.
                    <br><br>For the meaning of colors, normal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a> rules apply.
                    <br><br>Both players start out by choosing an English word to have the other player guess. Let's say you choose HELLO and Player 2 chooses WORLD.
                    <br><br>The game begins. Let's say Player 2 guesses VIDEO (for your hidden word). In normal Wordle, they would recieve that O was green and E was yellow. In TRICKLE, you get to mess with the results before feedback is sent to the other
                    player.
                </p>
                <div class="board-container">
                    <div class="word">
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">V</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">I</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">D</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square y-in y-out">E</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square g-in g-out">O</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Perhaps you think that knowing the letter O is in the last slot gives away too much of the word. You choose to place your TRICKLE on the final tile, and change it to a yellow tile.
                    <br>**Note: You could have changed O to a gray (incorrect) tile as well. You could have also chosen to keep the O as a green tile.
                </p>
                <div class="board-container">
                    <div class="word">
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">V</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">I</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">D</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square y-in y-out">E</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square r-out y-in">O</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You can place one TRICKLE each guess. After both players place their TRICKLEs, the manipulated feedback is sent back to the original players. In this case, player 2 would see the following.
                </p>
                <div class="board-container">
                    <div class="word">
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">V</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">I</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square x-in x-out">D</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square y-in y-out">E</div>
                        <div id="sq1-1" class="square y-in y-out">O</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Player 2 would know either one tile or no tiles have been TRICKLE'd. The player who guesses the other player's word first wins.
                </p>
